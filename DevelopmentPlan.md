# Project Development Plan Requirements

## Title:  


## Introduction (1 page):  
A general description of what you are modeling and why.  Here would be a good place to put in a brief (1/2 page) literature review describing the phenomena you're interested in (if applicable).  Make sure you properly cite references and do not plagiarize!

## Model Description (1-2 pages):  
Describe what your model will do and be capable of.  What assumptions will you make in your model?  What constraints will you have (and do you have data/can you get data to constrain your model)?  What could you model be used for?  What kinds of problems could it help solve?  What use-case limitations would your model have?  What would you need to overcome those use-case limitations?
 
Do not be too general in this section of your Development Plan.  The more specific and detailed you are, the more guidance it will provide for your project.  Note that this description should utilize the kinds of analysis S&S model for us.  For instance, in Ch. 1 as well as in the models they describe throughout the book and we've implemented, they go through a specific process of analysis of the problem, the structure of the model, describing the routines involved, etc.  Your description should follow their "template."

## Analysis (1 page):  
Describe what kinds of analysis you will do on the output of your model.  What metrics and quantities will you look at?  What questions will you ask of your model?  What can your model tell you about the phenomena you're interested in and its time evolution?  How will you validate/verify your model?

## Testing (1/2 page):  
You should have a testing suite for your model.  In this section, describe the kinds of tests you will provide.  You do not have to use a formal Python unit testing framework like unittest, nose, or pytest, but you need to have some sort of testing suite for your model.

## Personnel (1/2 page):  
A description of each member of your team, their areas of expertise, and a rough description of how the various tasks involved in the project will be divided amongst the team.  Note that I will assign groups with an eye to balancing areas of expertise within the group.

## Technologies (1/2 page):  
List and describe the various technologies you will use, and their role in your project.  Please note that for this assignment, you must write your program in Python.  Because this is a team software development project, you will need some way to do team development.  The technology you use must enable team development for both your code as well as all documents related to that code (e.g., your Powerpoint).  I recommend using GitHub.  You may use something else, but it must provide a record of commits for all team members over time.  I will use that record to help make any needed adjustments to the group grade to account for individual contributions.

## Benchmarks (1/2-1 page):   
A list and description of benchmarks, with dates as to when each benchmark will be finished.  Of these benchmarks, one will be graded.  Call that benchmark to be graded "Milestone" in your Development Plan.
